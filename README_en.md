> This is a task-driven field guide, not a rewritten feature manual. It starts with installation and a first successful task, then moves into office work, knowledge management, professional workflows, content automation, multi-agent systems, and reusable team practices.

## Read Online

The recommended reading experience is **[workbuddy.homes](https://workbuddy.homes/)**. The website provides full navigation, local search, page outlines, dark mode, rendered diagrams, and mobile support.

The book is currently written primarily in Simplified Chinese. English contributions and translation proposals are welcome.

## What Is Inside

| Section | Topics |
| --- | --- |
| Part I · User Manual | Installation, interface, first task, Skills, connectors, APIs, and automation |
| Part II · Cases | Office work, files, remote control, news, knowledge, meetings, investing, video, content, and GEO |
| Part III · Advanced | Building Skills, multi-agent system design, and reliable automation |
| Part IV · Roles and Industries | Role-based learning paths and industry workflows |
| Appendices | Reusable instructions and a scenario lookup table |

## How to Read

- **New to WorkBuddy**: start with Chapter 1 and complete Part I in order.
- **Have a specific task**: jump to a matching case in Part II, then use Part III to turn the result into a reusable system.
- **Rolling out to a team**: focus on Parts III and IV, including permissions, acceptance criteria, and failure recovery.

## Local Development
